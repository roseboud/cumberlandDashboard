# Cumberland Flood Dashboard — Changelog

**Date:** February 15, 2026
**Author:** Automated upgrade (AI-assisted)
**Branch:** Main

---

## Summary

The dashboard was upgraded from a demo/prototype into a production-ready, professional municipal flood risk application. Every layer of the application was touched: the UI, the data, and the map logic.

---

## What Changed

### 1. UI/UX — Complete Redesign

**Before:** Dark-only theme with emojis everywhere (🌊📡🚒📎), demo-quality styling.
**After:** Clean, professional municipality-grade interface.

| What | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Emojis | 20+ emojis in headers, labels, popups | Zero emojis — replaced with inline SVG icons |
| Theme | Dark-only (hardcoded navy colors) | Light mode (default) + Dark mode toggle |
| Font | Segoe UI | Inter (Google Fonts) with system fallbacks |
| Colors | Neon cyan (#00d4ff), hot pink (#e94560) | Muted government blues, clean grays |
| Header | "🌊 Cumberland Flood Dashboard" | "Cumberland County — Flood Risk Dashboard" with SVG logo |
| CSS | Hardcoded hex colors throughout | CSS Custom Properties (`--bg-primary`, `--text-primary`, etc.) |
| Theme persistence | N/A | Saves to `localStorage`, persists across sessions |

**Files changed:**
- `styles/map.css` — Completely rewritten (400+ lines)
- `index.html` — Completely rewritten (800+ lines)

### 2. Flood Data — Real LiDAR-Derived Inundation Models

**Before:** 5 hand-drawn polygons in `flood_100yr.json` with approximate coordinates.
**After:** 24 GeoJSON files converted from actual LiDAR-derived flood shapefiles.

| What was done | Details |
|---------------|---------|
| Source data | `assets/FundySide/Shapefiles/` and `assets/NorthSide/Shapefiles/` |
| Conversion | Python script (`convert_shapefiles.py`) using `geopandas` + `pyogrio` |
| Reprojection | NAD83(CSRS)v6 UTM Zone 20N → WGS84 (EPSG:4326) for Leaflet compatibility |
| Simplification | Geometry simplified (tolerance 0.00005°, ~5m) for web performance |
| Output | `assets/geojson/flood_fundy_X_0m.geojson` and `flood_north_X_0m.geojson` (X = 0–11) |
| Levels | 1.0m increments: 0m, 1m, 2m, 3m, 4m, 5m, 6m, 7m, 8m, 9m, 10m, 11m |

**New feature — Flood Slider:**
- Range slider (0–11m) in the sidebar lets you visualize progressive flooding
- Toggle buttons: "Both Sides", "Bay of Fundy", "Northumberland" to isolate regions
- Layer caching: once a level is loaded, revisiting it is instant (no re-fetch)
- Loading overlay shows while GeoJSON data is being fetched
- Color gradient: lighter blue at low levels → darker blue at high levels

### 3. Road Network — Real OpenStreetMap Data

**Before:** 4 hand-drawn LineStrings in `road_network.json` (approximate routes for TCH-104, Hwy 2, Route 302).
**After:** 965 real road segments fetched from OpenStreetMap Overpass API.

| What was done | Details |
|---------------|---------|
| Source | OpenStreetMap via Overpass API |
| Query | All motorway, trunk, primary, and secondary highways in the Cumberland County bounding box |
| Output | `assets/geojson/roads_cumberland.geojson` |
| Script | `fetch_osm_data.py` |
| Styling | Color-coded by road classification (motorway=purple, trunk=red, primary=orange, secondary=yellow) |
| Popups | Click any road segment to see name, reference number, classification, surface type |

### 4. Critical Infrastructure — Real OpenStreetMap Data

**Before:** 6 hardcoded markers with approximate lat/lng (fire stations, hospital, RCMP, EMO, Joggins, Parrsboro).
**After:** 101 real infrastructure facilities from OpenStreetMap.

| What was done | Details |
|---------------|---------|
| Source | OpenStreetMap via Overpass API |
| Facility types | Fire stations, hospitals, clinics, police, town halls, community centres, ambulance stations |
| Output | `assets/geojson/infrastructure_cumberland.geojson` |
| Styling | Color-coded circle markers (red=fire/emergency, green=healthcare, blue=police/government, purple=town hall, orange=community centre) |
| Popups | Click any marker to see name, type, address, data source |

### 5. Ocean Reference Points — Converted from Shapefiles

**Before:** Not used.
**After:** `oceanpoint_fundy.geojson` and `oceanpoint_north.geojson` converted from the FundySide/NorthSide shapefiles.

### 6. Base Map Options

**Before:** 3 options (OpenStreetMap, Topographic, Dark Mode CARTO).
**After:** 4 options (Street Map, Topographic, **Satellite** (Esri World Imagery), Dark).

### 7. Existing Features Preserved

These features from the original demo still work exactly as before:
- Live tide data from CHS/DFO-MPO API (Saint John, Charlottetown, Caribou)
- Auto-refresh every 5 minutes
- Status badges (NORMAL / ELEVATED / CRITICAL)
- File upload (drag-and-drop or click) for .geojson, .json, .csv
- User layer management (add/remove custom layers)
- Cursor position display (lat, lng, zoom)
- Toast notifications
- Responsive layout (mobile-friendly)

## New Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `assets/geojson/flood_fundy_0_0m.geojson` through `flood_fundy_11_0m.geojson` | Bay of Fundy flood inundation (12 levels) |
| `assets/geojson/flood_north_0_0m.geojson` through `flood_north_11_0m.geojson` | Northumberland flood inundation (12 levels) |
| `assets/geojson/roads_cumberland.geojson` | Real road network from OSM |
| `assets/geojson/infrastructure_cumberland.geojson` | Real infrastructure from OSM |
| `assets/geojson/oceanpoint_fundy.geojson` | Bay of Fundy ocean reference point |
| `assets/geojson/oceanpoint_north.geojson` | Northumberland ocean reference point |
| `convert_shapefiles.py` | Python script to convert .shp → .geojson |
| `fetch_osm_data.py` | Python script to fetch road/infrastructure from OSM |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | This file |
| `HOSTING_GUIDE.md` | Guide for deploying to the web |

## How to Run Locally

Same as before — nothing changed in the dev workflow:

```bash
cd cumberlandDashboard
python -m http.server 8080
# Open http://localhost:8080
```

Or use VS Code Live Server extension (right-click `index.html` → Open with Live Server).

---

## Dependencies Added

For the data conversion scripts only (not needed to run the dashboard):

```bash
pip install geopandas pyogrio pyproj shapely
```

The dashboard itself is still **zero-dependency** — just HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Leaflet (loaded from CDN).
